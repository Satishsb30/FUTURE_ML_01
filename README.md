# FUTURE_ML_01 – Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to forecast sales using historical data.
It helps businesses understand demand trends and improve decision-making.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering (Day, Month, Year)
3. Model training using Linear Regression
4. Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
5. Visualization of actual vs predicted sales

## Business Insights
The model supports inventory planning, demand forecasting, and financial optimization.

## Track
Machine Learning (ML)
